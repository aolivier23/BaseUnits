protonMass is 938.3 MeV
protonEnergy is 1034 MeV
ke is 95.7 MeV
dEdx is 9.57 (MeV) / (cm)
ke + protonMass is 1034 MeV
dx started as 10 cm
After modification, dx is 5 cm
I added 15 cm to dx: 20 cm
I've negated dx: -20 cm
20 cm < 30 cm?  true
20 cm < 11 cm?  false
39 cm > 30 cm?  true
39 cm > 40.1 cm?  false
987 events == 987 events?  true
987 events != 988 events?  true
The smaller of 20 cm and 30 cm is 20 cm
Printing a product of 5 types: 2.98584e+07 cm * MeV * cm * cm * cm
The answer I get by hand is: 2.98584e+07
Proton mass, which is 938.3 MeV, is 0.9383 in GeV
Proton energy, which is 1034 MeV, is 1034 in MeV
Proton mass, which is 938.3 MeV, is 938.3 in MeV
Proton energy, which is 1034 MeV, is 1.034 in GeV
9.57 (MeV) / (cm) over 2.98584e+07 cm * MeV * cm * cm * cm is 3.20513e-07 (MeV) / (cm * cm * MeV * cm * cm * cm)
34.4667 (MeV) / (cm) over 9.57 (MeV) / (cm) is 3.60153 (MeV * cm) / (cm * MeV)
34.4667 (MeV) / (cm) times 9.57 (MeV) / (cm) is 329.846 (MeV * MeV) / (cm * cm)
Product of 3 derived types: 9.84867e+09 (MeV * MeV * cm * MeV * cm * cm * cm) / (cm * cm)
